We focus on the most essential variants of coordinate descent algorithm: randomized coordinate descent and accelerated randomized coordinate descent algorithms. The fundamental theorems behind the algorithms are introduced with reference to convex objectives. Besides, we compare the iteration complexity of randomized coordinate descent and accelerated randomized coordinate descent for Kaczmarz algorithm applied in linear equations and unconstrained minimization problem. The simulation shows consistent results with the theoretical methodology: accelerated randomized CD algorithm performs best when solving linear system and empirical risk minimization problem.
